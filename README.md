# jellifinflix
This docker creates .ignore files in empty folders so that empty folders are ignored in the library.
A cron job runs every 6 hours by default which can be customized using CRON_STRING env variable. Also you can pass jellyfin api key and jellyfin server url as environment variables to run jellyfin library refresh after every replace.

# Install
